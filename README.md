Manage foosball matches

This app helps you to manage foosball matches in your office. Especially after lunch, everybody wants to play
before going back to work. The problem is that you have to find one or three partners to play a single or a double.
So register at <core-foos> for a single or a double and <core-foos> informs you as soon as a match can start, i.e., the
table is available and there are enough players available.
